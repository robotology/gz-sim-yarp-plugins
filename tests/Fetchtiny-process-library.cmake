  # We don't want to install this library in the system, we instead
  # compile it as an OBJECT library and embed in either the shared or
  # static libraries that need it.
  # From https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/18935 it seems
  # that OBJECT libraries that are not installed become INTERFACE when
  # part of an EXPORT set.
  # This behaviour allows setting transitively tiny-process-library infos
  # to the consuming targets while not breaking the EXPORT process. In fact,
  # the conversion to INTERFACE allows to add tiny-process-library to the
  # targets of the EXPORT that contains targets linking against it.
  # See also https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2018-September/068250.html.
